#What rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* does:
#This command removes the package lists that apt-get update downloads. 
#When you run apt-get update, it downloads metadata about available packages and stores it in /var/lib/apt/lists/. 
#After installing your packages, you don't need this metadata anymore, 
#so removing it helps reduce your Docker image size. 
#This is a common Docker best practice for keeping images lean.
